<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 The arena</A>
</H2>

<P>The arena is the square area where the bots fight. The size of the arena is
decided at the time the simulation is started, but it is somewhere between
8192 - 65536 units on each of the axis. One pixel on the screen is 64 units in the game.
<P>In the arena there is room for a multitude of objects. The most important are the up
to 8 bots that fight for supremacy. But other objects also existing are objects
released by the bots (as for example shots).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 The bots</A>
</H2>

<P>The 'bots' are our main object of attention here. They are 'modules' designed and
programmed in order to rule the arena.They consist of two main parts: The hardware
chosen, and the program that makes use of and steers the hardware. When you create
your bots you have a certain number of slots available, where you can choose to
put any of some 20 different sorts of hardware. (Assuming the config allows them).
You also choose how good version of the hardware you want.
<P>When you have chosen all the hardware you must write a program in "bot ASM" to steer
the hardware. An intel x86:ish asm language adapted for this purpose. (Actually, there
might be "compilers" for higher level language available, but they are a different story).
<P>When the simulation is running, the CPU devices you have included in your bot executes
the program you wrote. Firing weapons to inflict damage on each other the bots eventually
get killed. This occurs when the damage absorbtion devices of a bot is unable to take
care of all damage that comes in. The most important value here is the 'armour value'.
<P>This value is the amount of armour your bot has left, if a hit removes more armour then
you have, your bot dies.
However, not only enemy activity can remove your armour; Many activities of your bot
generates "heat". Letting the heat go high will also burn off armour. Though it won't
kill your bot directly, the bot is then very vulnerable to even the smallest hit.
<P>Some hardware is virtually necessary for your bot (CPU,scanner,armour etc...) and some
hardware is entirely optional. It's up to you to decide what is needed.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Config Rules</A>
</H2>

<P>For tournaments, and sake of comparison it might be good to regulate the designs of
the bots somewhat. This is done in a config file, and is enforced as such:
<P>All devices cost 'money' and takes a slot in your bot. The config file defines the
number of slots available as well as the total amount of money your bot is
allowed to cost. It also defines how much each of those devices cost at each of the
five version levels.
<P>If you try to start a simulation with a bot that breaks the config rules the
simulator will notify you of that.
<P>As such. When you create your bots, you might want to keep a certain config in mind.
Perhaps the config is one of a special tournament running on the net, or one that
your friends and you agreed upon for your personal rumbles.
