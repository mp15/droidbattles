In the config editor you can edit the allowed configurations of the bots.
If you want to have som "sane" values to start with press "load default
values".

The first setting sets how many devices a bot should be allowed to have.
The maximum is 32.

The second is the maximum "cost" of the bot. Each device cost "money" and
the cost can be different for different devices.
And the costs should be different for different levels of a device.
To ensure that you can't allways take the best level of all devices but
instead force some tactics into the design of the bots this value should
be balanced.

The next setting is the maximum amount of RAM usage that should be allowed...
The more RAM that's allowed, the more code and data-tables and such can be
used.

And in the editable combobox you can set the cost of RAM for each amount.
The first element corresponds to the first amount of RAM and so on.

Then comes the settings for each device.
There are currently three settings available (more to come).
1. If the device is allowed to use

2. The cost of the device at each of the five levels.

3. The value for the device at each level.
This setting means different things for different devices, so here is a list:

CPU: The number of cycles the CPU has each round
Engine: The maximum speed
steering: the number of botgrades it can turn each round
plasmagun: the reload value for the gun (the higher, the faster he reloads)
armor: The amount of armour he gives you
scanner: maximum length of scanarc
fuel: amount of fuel
chaff: amount of chaffs available
turret: turnrate per cycle
scanwarner: N/A
timedev: N/A
shield: percentage of damage absorbed
repair: countdown value till next reparation (lower means faster repair)
radio: N/A
minelayer: amount of mines
missile: Countdown value till next fire (lower means faster rate of fire)
beam: Amount of heat generated firing a shot
AS-Rocket: Decrease in readiness for each fires rocket (lower means faster fire)
cloaker: Amount of cloaking (decrease in radar signature)
Chiller: Amount of cooling effect each round

When you've created and saved your configs you can make them the currently used
configs by pressing "Apply current config".
