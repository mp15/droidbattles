<P>
<P>This section provides more details of all the hardware
available to the bot...
<P>In the port listings first the name of the port is listed and then a ddescription.
The name is the predefined constant of the port and is of this form:
<P>CPU#_GetXSize
<P>First the name of the hardware,
# stands for the number of the hardware eg. the first CPU has a 0 there and the fifth has a 4
there. Then after that comes _ with the name of the port
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 CPU:</A>
</H2>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
The CPU device is the device that runs the actual program.
It can execute numerous opcodes.

In addition to that it can take two parameters:

%CPUboot and %CPUstack

..
..
nop
nop

%CPUboot 0
:label
nop
nop

%CPUstack
:label2

This means that the first device CPU will boot at position :label
and that it's stack memory starts at label2
This is especially important if you use multiple CPU:s

inports:
first: CPU#_GetXSize, get X-size of battlearea
second: CPU#_GetYSize, get Y-size of battlearea
third: CPU#_GetBattleType, get type of battle (0-normal,1-survival,2-deathmatch)
fourth: CPU#_GetMyTeam, get team/frequency of your bot.

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
The engine device is what regulates with what speed your bot moves

outports:
first: Engine#_SetThrust, set the wanted speed
second: Engine#_SetReverseThrust, set the wanted reverse speed

<H2><A NAME="ss9.3">9.3 Steering:</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
The steering device makes your bot turn

It can steer a certain number of botgrades each round (determined by config).
There are 1024 botgrades on a circle, and the botgrade 0 is straight to the right.

outports:
first: Steering#_AdjustWantedDir, adjust-heading, The value is relative to the
current aimed heading and is in botgrades, To turn right 8 botgrades: out 0*,8
To turn left: out 0*,1016

second: Steering#_SetDir, Aim at absolute heading
out 1*, 512 ;Go straight left

third: Steering#_AdjustCurrentDir, Sort of like the first, but the value isn't
relative to the aimed heading, but relative to the current "real" heading. This
can prevent the "overflow" problem...

* Adjust for the position of the device

inports:
first: Steering#_GetDir, get current dir
second: Steering#_GetWantedDir, get current wanted dir
third: Steering#_GetXpos, get X-position

<PRE>
AS-rocket is a weapon that as the beam have a certain distance set.
When it is fired it goes that distance then explodes giving all
objects nearby damage. The rocket is NOT affected by any other
objects on the way to the goal, so the only way to get away is to
move...

outports:
first: Rocket#_SetDistance, set distance
second: Rocket#_FireRocket, fire a rocket

inports:
first: Rocket#_GetReadiness, get readiness (max 200)
second: Rocket#_GetDistance, get distance

<H2><A NAME="ss9.17">9.17 chaff</A>
</H2>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Chaff is a device that emits chaffs. That is , radar reflecting debris
that to enemy(and friendly) scanners appears to be bots, but really is
some sort of decoy. They live for 320 cycles before they dissolve.
They goes of in the same direction your bot is traveling (only at half your
speed).

outports:
first: Chaff#_ReleaseDebris, fire debris

inports:
first: Chaff#_GetDebris, get number of debris left
</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.18">9.18 Scanwarner/detector</A>
</H2>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
This device keeps a count of how many times you've been scanned and can give
you some info about te last scan against you.

outports:
first: ScanWarn#_ZeroCounter, zero counter

inports:
first: ScanWarn#_GetNumScans, return counter (number of turns scanned)
second: ScanWarn#_GetScanDir, return the approximate dir for last scan
( ~128 botgrades error margain )
third: ScanWarn#_GetScanIntensity, return "intensity" for last scan

This value is calculated by adding two values:
first value is a value over how much in center of the scan you were
(center means 0 points, on the edge means 2 points)
The second is a value of how near the enemy bot were when he scanned you, that is
if you were in his lowest third of his scanners range this value is 0 and if you are
almost at the edge of his range this value is 2.
the value returned is thus 0-4.

<H2><A NAME="ss9.19">9.19 Chiller</A>
</H2>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
This device helps cooling your bot each round. Even when doing passive cooling
it helps,but activating active cooling doubles the cooling effect. However,
active cooling uses fuel.

none

<H2><A NAME="ss9.20">9.20 Cloak device</A>
</H2>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
This device lowers your radar signature, so that your bots appear to scanners to
be of the size of a smaller object. If enemy scanners have their sensitivity set
higher they wondt see you, however, enabling cloak will use fuel and generate heat

Outports:
first: Cloak#_EnableCloak, Set cloak on/off

Inports:
none
